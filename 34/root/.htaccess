RewriteEngine on

# Does not apply to existing directories, meaning that if the folder exists on the server then don't change anything and don't run the Rule!

ReWriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

# Check for file in directory with .html extension

ReWriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}\.html -f

# Here we actually show the page that has the html extension

# The regular expression grabs the URL and appends a .html on the end, the NC means to ignore case, the L means that the conditions above only apply for this rule
